Package
=======

``LatticeQM`` includes several modules:

 * ``Algebra``: some wrappers for dense and sparse diagonalization.
 * ``Geometries``: Pre-defined lattice geometries (such as two-dimensional honeycomb lattice)
 * ``Green``: Green function-related computations.
 * ``LinearResponse``: Calculate linear response coefficients, such as optical conductivity
 * ``Meanfield``: Self-consistent mean field iteration routines.
 * ``Operators``: Convenience methods to construct tight-binding lattice operators.
 * ``Spectrum``: Sparse and dense exact diagonalization methods.
 * ``Structure``: Methods and structs to define and manipulate (periodic) lattices.
 * ``TightBinding``: Methods and structs to define and manipulate tight-binding operators.


The package ``KPM.jl`` implementing the Kernel Polynomial Method, was outsourced into a
seperate package.
