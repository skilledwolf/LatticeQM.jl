LatticeQM is a Julia package for lattice structures and tight-binding models: build operators, compute bands and expectation values, and study mean-field, linear response, and Floquet physics. Licensed under AGPL-3.0-only.

## Installation
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("LatticeQM")
```

## Documentation
- See `extra/docs` for the documentation source. Build with:
  `julia --project=extra/docs -e 'include("extra/docs/make.jl")'`, then open `extra/docs/build/index.html`.

## Acknowledgements
- I thank Dr. Oded Zilberberg and Dr. Gianni Blatter for their guidance and support as my thesis advisors; I developed the package in the course of my PhD research. 
- Tobias Kästli (@vigoleis) contributed the Floquet module as part of his Master's project and authored the accompanying tutorial.
